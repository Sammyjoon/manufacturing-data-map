# Manufacturer Data Map (D3.js Interactive)

This project is an interactive manufacturing data map visualization built with D3.js. It helps users—especially manufacturing SMEs—map out machines/processes and their data connections, assign importance, and calculate a data maturity score.

## 🚀 Features

- **Add Machines/Processes:** Build your own network by adding nodes representing equipment, software, or processes.
- **Connect with Edges:** Define data flows or relationships between machines/processes, with labeled maturity levels.
- **Set Importance:** Click any node to set its importance (1-5) for weighted maturity analysis.
- **Calculate Maturity:** Instantly compute a node-weighted maturity score for your map.
- **Save/Load Maps:** Download your map as a JSON file or load a previous map.
- **Responsive UI:** Modern, clean, and mobile-friendly layout.

## 📝 How to Use

1. **Open the App:**  
   Open [[visualization.html](cci:7://file:///Users/sammieomranian/Downloads/Data%20map/CSI%20Data%20Map%202/visualization.html:0:0-0:0)](./visualization.html) in your browser, or visit the GitHub Pages link above.

2. **Add Machines/Processes:**  
   Use the dropdown to add new nodes to your map.

3. **Create Edges:**  
   Select source and target nodes, choose a label, and click "Add Edge" to connect them.

4. **Set Importance:**  
   Click any node to assign its importance (1 = least, 5 = most important).

5. **Calculate Maturity:**  
   Click "Calculate Data Maturity" to see your network’s maturity level.

6. **Save/Load:**  
   Use "Save Graph" to download your map as JSON. Use the file input to load a saved map.
