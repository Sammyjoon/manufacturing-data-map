# Manufacturer Data Map (D3.js Interactive)

This project is an interactive manufacturing data map visualization built with D3.js. It helps users‚Äîespecially manufacturing SMEs‚Äîmap out machines/processes and their data connections, assign importance, and calculate a data maturity score.

## üöÄ Features

- **Add Machines/Processes:** Build your own network by adding nodes representing equipment, software, or processes.
- **Connect with Edges:** Define data flows or relationships between machines/processes, with labeled maturity levels.
- **Set Importance:** Click any node to set its importance (1-5) for weighted maturity analysis.
- **Calculate Maturity:** Instantly compute a node-weighted maturity score for your map.
- **Save/Load Maps:** Download your map as a JSON file or load a previous map.
- **Responsive UI:** Modern, clean, and mobile-friendly layout.
